## Course Summary
D210 Representation and Reporting focuses on communicating observations and patterns to diverse stakeholders, a key aspect of the data analytics life cycle. This course helps students gain communication and storytelling skills. It also covers data visualizations, audio representations, and interactive dashboards.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Data Visualization**: The graduate creates data representations to offer insight into an organizational problem.
- **Business Intelligence**: The graduate communicates data insights to technical and nontechnical audiences.
- **Executive Dashboards**: The graduate designs executive decision support with interactive tools.
  
## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This project requires the student to use one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and an additional external dataset of their own choosing to generate a series of data visualizations about the two datasets. These visualizations are developed in Tableau, a Business Intelligence tool, to generate interactive dashboards with filtering capability. The student then gives a presentation of these finished dashboards to an executive board for their chosen dataset (medical or churn) with Business Intelligence and insights generated from both datasets.

For this project, I used the [JB Link Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnflag/jb-link-telco-customer-churn) file as my external dataset.
