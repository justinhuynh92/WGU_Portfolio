## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This project requires the student to use one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and an additional external dataset of their own choosing to generate a series of data visualizations about the two datasets. These visualizations are developed in Tableau, a Business Intelligence tool, to generate interactive dashboards with filtering capability. The student then gives a presentation of these finished dashboards to an executive board for their chosen dataset (medical or churn) with Business Intelligence and insights generated from both datasets.

My research question for this task is “What factors most significantly contribute to the monthly charge of the customers?”
