# D211: Advanced Data Acquisition
## Course Summary
D211 Advanced Data Acquisition enhances theoretical and SQL skills in furthering the data analytics life cycle. This course covers advanced SQL operations, aggregating data, and acquiring data from various sources in support of core organizational needs. 

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Advanced SQL, Joins, Unions**: The graduate applies advanced SQL operations to integrate multiple data sources.
- **Data Sourcing**: The graduate explores data acquisition.
  
## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This project is largely identical to the previous project, in its requirement to use both a provided dataset and an external one of the student's selection to generate Business Intelligence to be presented to an executive board. The main difference between the prior course and this one is that this is performed on a virtual machine, where the external dataset must be incorporated into an existing PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin. This requires that all data cleaning and preparations are performed in SQL, rather than Python. A database connection is then generated in Tableau to create a permanent connection that allows the student's dashboards to update whenever the database is updated.

For this project, I used the [JB Link Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnflag/jb-link-telco-customer-churn) file as my external dataset.
