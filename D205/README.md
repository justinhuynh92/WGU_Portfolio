# D205: Data Acquisition

## Course Summary
D205 Data Acquisition builds proficiency in Structured Query Language (SQL) and the initial stages of the data analytics lifecycle. The course introduces relational databases. Students gain concrete skills in data transference and database manipulation.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Dimension, Quality Relations, and Limitations**: The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
- **Physical Data Models**: The graduate implements physical data models.
- **Table Operations**: The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
This project requires the student to access a virtual machine and use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to import an external `.csv` file into an existing database as a new table, designing conceptual, logical, and physical models describing this. Once imported, the database must then be explored and generate SQL queries to answer the research question.

My research question for this project is “How many people who use Fiber Optic service make at least six figures?”
