# D209: Data Mining I

## Course Summary
D209 Data Mining I expands predictive modeling into nonlinear dimensions, enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of the data analytics lifecycle. In this course, learners implement supervised models—specifically classification and prediction data mining models—to unearth relationships among variables that are not apparent with more surface-level techniques. The course provides frameworks for assessing models’ sensitivity and specificity.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Classification Data Mining Models**: The graduate applies observations to appropriate classes and categories using classification models.
- **Predictive Data Mining Models**: The graduate implements prediction data mining models to find hard-to-spot relationships among variables.
- **Predictive Data Mining Models**: The graduate evaluates data mining model performance for precision, accuracy, and model comparison.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
**Task 1**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) or Naive Bayes classification analysis. Students identify a set of variables to use and split the data into training and test sets before performing their classification analysis to answer this research question.

My research question for this task is “What factors most significantly contribute to the monthly charge of the customers?”

**Task 2**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and decision trees, random forests, or advanced regression (lasso or ridge) analysis. Students identify a set of variables to use and split the data into training and test sets before performing their classification analysis to answer this research question.

My research question for this task is “What factors most significantly contribute to whether customers will churn or not?”
