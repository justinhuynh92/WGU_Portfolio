# D212: Data Mining II

## Course Summary
D214 The Data Analytics Graduate Capstone allows students to apply the academic and professional abilities developed as a graduate student. This capstone challenges students to integrate skills and knowledge from several program domains into one project.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Professional Readiness**: The graduate integrates and synthesizes competencies from across the degree program, demonstrating the ability to participate in and contribute value to the chosen professional field.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
**Task 1**

This task requires students to develop a proposal for the topic of their capstone project, beginning with defining the intended research question as well as the null and alternative hypotheses for the study. Students must explain the context of the intended research and justify the processes, techniques, and tools to be used in the course of gathering, preparing, and analyzing the data. The capstone project is required to be "business-oriented" as a means to demonstrate preparation for entering the professional realm from the academic. A number of topics are also listed as being "retired" by WGU because they have been previously covered, meaning that these topics may not be selected for capstone research.

My research question for this task is “How does the marketing channel used in digital campaigns impact customer conversion rates, and which channel is the most effective in driving conversions?”

**Task 2**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (over 50 features). The student identifies the number of principal components and the variance of each component, before addressing the research question with those principal components.

My research question for this task is “Can we reduce the dimensionality of customer usage data to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn?”

**Task 3**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question regarding one of two new datasets, using market basket analysis and association rules to analyze customer behaviors.

My research question for this task is “What are the common product combinations purchased by customers?”
