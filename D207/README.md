# D207: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Course Summary
D207 Exploratory Data Analysis covers statistical principles supporting the data analytics life cycle. Students in this course compute and interpret measures of central tendency, correlations, and variation. The course introduces hypothesis testing, focusing on application for parametric tests, and addresses communication skills and tools to explain an analyst’s findings to others within an organization.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Data Interpretation**: The graduate interprets central tendency, correlations, and variation to inform organizational decisions.
- **Conducting Parametric Testing**: The graduate conducts parametric hypothesis testing.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
This course has a single Practical Assessment. This project requires the student to use one of the provided datasets (medical or churn) and develop a research question to be analyzed by using one of chi-square, t-test, or ANOVA techniques to test a hypothesis relating to that research question. The student must also develop a number of univariate and bivariate statistics describing variables in the dataset.

My research question for this project is “Does a relationship exist between people who were never married and those with a longer contract?”
