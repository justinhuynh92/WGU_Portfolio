# D212: Data Mining II

## Course Summary
D212 Data Mining II adds vital tools to the data analytics arsenal that incorporates unsupervised models. This course explains when, how, and why to use these tools to best meet organizational needs.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Hierarchical & K-Means Clustering Techniques**: The graduate applies clustering techniques to accurately predict outcomes of interest.
- **Principal Component Analysis**: The graduate implements dimension reduction methods to identify significant variables.
- **Market Basket Analysis**: The graduate predicts patterns in data using association rules and lift analysis.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
**Task 1**

This project requires the student to use one either k-means or hierarchical clustering on one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) to analyze the data. After selecting the variables of interest, the student generates a clustering model to facilitate this analysis. The student then communicates the results of their analysis and evaluates the model.

My research question for this task is “Can we segment customers into different groups based on their usage patterns (monthly charges, bandwidth usage) to better understand who is at risk of churn?”

**Task 2**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset (over 50 features). The student identifies the number of principal components and the variance of each component, before addressing the research question with those principal components.

My research question for this task is “Can we reduce the dimensionality of customer usage data to identify key factors that contribute to customer churn?”

**Task 3**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question regarding one of two new datasets, using market basket analysis and association rules to analyze customer behaviors.

My research question for this task is “What are the common product combinations purchased by customers?”
