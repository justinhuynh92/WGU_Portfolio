# D206: Data Cleaning

## Course Summary
D206 Data Cleaning continues building proficiency in the data analytics life cycle with data preparation skills. This course addresses exploring, transforming, and imputing data as well as handling outliers. Students write code to manipulate, structure, and clean data as well as to reduce features in data sets.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Dimension, Quality Relations, and Limitations**: The graduate examines the data available for analysis to determine their dimension, quality, relations, and limitations.
- **Physical Data Models**: The graduate implements physical data models.
- **Table Operations**: The graduate performs table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
This course has a single Practical Assessment. This project requires the student to select one of two datasets (medical system readmission or telecom customer churn) in .csv format for cleaning. Once cleaned, this dataset will be explored to answer a research question developed by the student. The student will then perform Principal Component Analysis of the dataset in order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Note that these same datasets, with some occasional modifications, will continue to be used throughout the bulk of the MSDA program for practical assessments.

My research question for this project is “Does a relationship exist between people who have a Master’s degree and people who have a longer contract??” My summary for this project, including the all of my Python code, can be viewed [here.](WGU_D205_Task_1.pdf)

This task required a video presentation, demonstrating the successful operation of all code included in my report and covering certain aspects of the report. That video can be seen [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lt1DGjlEZ5FYWoo2KxfNEP3DncrUrPZx/view?usp=drive_link)
