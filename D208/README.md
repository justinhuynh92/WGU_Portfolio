# D208: Predictive Modeling

## Course Summary
D208 Predictive Modeling builds on initial data preparation, cleaning, and analysis, enabling students to make assertions vital to organizational needs. In this course, students conduct logistic regression and multiple regression to model the phenomena revealed by data. The course covers normality, homoscedasticity, and significance, preparing students to communicate findings and the limitations of those findings accurately to organizational leaders.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Logistic Regression**: The graduate employs logistic regression algorithms in describing phenomena.
- **Multiple Regression**: The graduate employs multiple regression algorithms with categorical and numerical predictors in describing phenomena.
- **Regression Implications**: The graduate makes assertions based on regression modeling.

## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
**Task 1**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and multiple regression to answer this question. Students create an initial multiple regression model, and generate a reduced multiple regression model by selecting variables based on a statistical justification and a model evaluation metric. Students also generate a number of univariate and bivariate visualizations of variables within the dataset.

My research question for this task is “What factors most significantly contribute to the monthly charge of the customers?”
