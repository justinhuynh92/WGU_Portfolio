# D213: Advanced Data Analysis

## Course Summary
D213 Advanced Data Analytics prepares students for career-long growth in steadily advancing tools and techniques and provides emerging concepts in data analysis. This course hones the mental and theoretical flexibility that will be required of analysts in the coming decades while grounding their approach firmly in ethical and organizational-need-focused practice. Topics include machine learning, neural networks, randomness, and unconventional data sources.

## Course Objectives
WGU outlines the following competencies as a part of this class:
- **Time Series Analysis**: The graduate applies time series models in generating forecasts.
- **Neural Networks**: The graduate builds neural networks in the context of machine-learning modeling.
- **Natural Language Processing**: The graduate extracts insights from text data using effective and appropriate natural processing (NLP) models.
- 
## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files
**Task 1**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and ARIMA/SARIMA time series modelling techniques. The student must generate a number of time series visualizations, evaluate the stationarity of the series, account for trends and seasonality, and develop a forecast in the course of addressing this research question.

My research question for this task is “How can we predict future revenue trends and identify potential periods of declining revenue in the company's first two years of operation based on historical daily revenue data?”

**Task 2**

This project requires the student to develop and answer a research question, using one of the two provided datasets (medical or churn) and decision trees, random forests, or advanced regression (lasso or ridge) analysis. Students identify a set of variables to use and split the data into training and test sets before performing their classification analysis to answer this research question.

My research question for this task is “How can sentiment analysis of customer reviews from the Amazon, IMDb, and Yelp files be used to predict the likelihood of customer satisfaction with these products, movies, and services?”
