# WGU_Portfolio

This is a portfolio of my work in the BS Data Management & Data Analysis (BSDMDA) and MS Data Analysis (MSDA) degree programs at Western Governors University. I completed my education to make a career change into data science, and this portfolio showcases that work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in those programs. I benefitted tremendously from the tips and advice of prior students throughout my educational journey, and this is a part of my ongoing issue to return the favor and ensure more people get up the ladder that I've finished climbing.
